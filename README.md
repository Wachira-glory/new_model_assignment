In this Python project, I developed a comprehensive School data model that accurately represents the complex relationships between students, teachers, courses, and other school-related entities. I defined entities such as Student, Teacher, Course, Department, and School, each with unique attributes and relationships, such as a student enrolling in multiple courses, a teacher teaching multiple courses, and a course being taught by one teacher. I implemented data validation to ensure attribute constraints are met and used object-oriented programming principles and Python's built-in data structures to design a robust and scalable data model, showcasing my ability to create a maintainable and efficient data structure for a school system.
